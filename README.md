# Portfolio-Life-Expectancy-and-GDP
Project Title
Life Expectancy and GDP Data Visualization for Six Countries (2000-2015)

Introduction / Overview
•	This project explores the relationship between life expectancy and Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of six countries from 2000 to 2015. 
•	The objective is to identify the trends between economic growth and improvement in health and longevity through data visualizations.
•	Comparisons highlight similarities and differences over time. 
	
Dataset
•	The data was provided by Codecademy and sourced from World Health Organization and the World Bank.
•	The dataset contains years, country names, life expectancy, and GDP values. 
•	It covers the years 2000 to 2015 for six countries: Chile, China, Germany, Mexico, USA, and Zimbabwe.

Questions / Objectives
1.	What do the trends look like?
2.	Which country has highest/lowest life expectancy and GDP?
3.	Which year has the highest/lowest life expectancy and GDP?
4.	Are there countries with low GDP but high life expectancy or vice versa?
5.	Are there outliers or unusual patterns?
6.	How do the differences between countries change over time?
7.	Is there a correlation between GDP and life expectancy?

Methods
•	The analysis includes data inspection and standardization, and data visualizations.
•	Line, box, and scatter plots are used to visualize and analyse the data. 
•	Libraries such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Numpy are used.

Key Findings
•	Life expectancy for all countries except Zimbabwe shows a positive linear trend. Zimbabwe had a decline then increased rapidly from 2004 to 2015. 
•	The gap in between China and other countries narrowed over time, while Zimbabwe’s gap decreased rapidly after 2004. 
•	Germany had the highest life expectancy, followed by Chile, USA, Mexico, China, and lastly Zimbabwe. 
•	Year 2000 recorded the lowest life expectancy, while 2015 the highest. 
•	Chile, Mexico, and USA show normal distributions. China and Germany are left-skewed, while Zimbabwe is right-skewed.
•	GDP increased for all countries except Zimbabwe, which remained stable. 
•	China’s GDP quadrupled, and USA almost doubled.  
•	USA had the highest GDP, followed by China (which surpassed Germany around 2007), Germany, Mexico, Chile, and Zimbabwe. 
•	Year 2000 had the lowest GDP, 2015 the highest. 
•	No country had low GDP with high life expectancy or vice versa.
•	No outliers were observed, but some distributions are skewed.
•	Zimbabwe's life expectancy improved even with stable GDP, but correlation does not imply causation.
